/// - TODO: Really need to think about whether we should pass the store in directly to the setup
/// and update methods. Can we reduce the API surface area of Store that middleware use and bring it
/// down to a couple of functions that get passed in? Then again full access to the store does enable
/// some really powerful behaviour. One way to bridge the gap may be to improve the API for finding
/// models. At present there is find(type:) and allModels. Maybe we could introduce an AnyModel
/// to be used to select all models, and provide an overload of find(type:) that returns an array?
/// Then weâ€™d be a step closer to being able to just provide a (non-store-retaining) function that
/// returns models rather than the full store.
